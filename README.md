# Data Science with the Star Wars API!
The goal of this repository is twofold:

1. Make the Star Wars API more accessible by providing functions that create clean data frames for each category (starships, planets, people, etc.)

2. Practice some analytic techniques on data from a galaxy far far away

## Map of Directory

The file sw_df_convert provides functions to create clean data frames for a category.

For example, the function get_starship_df will pull the starship data frame

_Note: I've only worked on starships and planets so far, I'll update as I get other data frames_
